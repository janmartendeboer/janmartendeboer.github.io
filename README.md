# Introduction

Hello, my name is Jan-Marten de Boer. I'm a Dutch born and raised technology
enthusiast.

## Interests

My main hobbies and interests involve:

- Walking in nature
- Philanthropy
- Playing around with LEGOs
- Video games, in particular "The legend of Zelda"
- Creating a new programming language (public link will follow)

## Activities

In the past I've been known to:

- Volunteer at charities and community centers
- Help small businesses with (creating) their technology stack
- Speak at programming centric events

## Strengths

My strengths can be found in my work as Senior developer for
[MediaCT](https://www.mediact.com/team) and
[Magement](https://www.magement.com/company).
I thrive when working together on complex decision making processes and seem
able to identify when a component of an application has wrong responsibilities
and how this needs to be separated to allow better decoupling and maintainability.

## Weaknesses

My ability to trust people isn't what I'd like it to be and is my main character
flaw. Although I am quite capable of letting go of and to delegate work, I will
follow up on it afterward, until someone has proven this to be unnecessary.
This is great for quality assurance, but less so for stress levels.
