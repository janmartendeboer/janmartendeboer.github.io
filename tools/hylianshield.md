# HylianShield

The Hylian Shield, traditionally bore by the Knights of Hyrule, bearing the
symbol of the Triforce, pointed at by the Crimson Loftwing.

With a passion for Zelda games, the name HylianShield seemed most fitting for an
open source organization, focusing on shielding code from malicious user input.

The [HylianShield organization](https://github.com/HylianShield/) was created as
a home for the [HylianShield validator](https://github.com/HylianShield/validator).
This validator was originally born from a previous attempt to setting up a static
site generator. That generator was extremely reliant on good structured JSON.
Without knowledge of JSON Schema validation, it achieved something fairly similar
within a templating engine.

With all this stray logic inside a templating engine, it deserved a home of its
own. Thus, the HylianShield validator was created.

Today, the organization holds more than just the validation suite. A few of them
are:

* [A PHP implementation of Crockford's Base 32 encoding](https://github.com/HylianShield/base32-crockford).
* [An API key / serial generator](https://github.com/HylianShield/key-generator).
* [An Alphabet library](https://github.com/HylianShield/alphabet), to support encoders and cryptography.
* [A Symfony Bundle to locate files in vendor packages](https://github.com/HylianShield/vendor-locator-bundle).

Feel free to take a look around. All packages are open source and new input is welcome.
