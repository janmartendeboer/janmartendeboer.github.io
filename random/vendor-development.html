                <h1>Developing in vendor directories</h1>
<p>In a recent version og PhpStorm, the IDE automatically excludes folders
that are stored under the Composer vendor directory.</p>
<p>Whether it is because of something PhpStorm does, or happens because of an
installed Composer plugin, is besides the point.</p>
<p>As a result of this, a conversation sparked up about whether one should develop
files that are stored in the vendor directory.</p>
<h2>Misconceptions about the vendor directory</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One should not edit files under vendor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Editing vendor packages is debatable. There are some things you should be aware
of and set up, before starting to edit vendor packages. If you rock a default
Composer configuration, I would say editing vendor packages is indeed a bad
practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you change anything inside the vendor directory, your next <code>composer update</code>
will write over your changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points out a misconception caused by the default behavior of Composer, due
to its default configuration.</p>
<h2>When not to edit files in a vendor directory</h2>
<p>If you use the default configuration of Composer, it will have a preferred
installation strategy for all packages set to <code>auto</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out a lot of developers are unaware that Composer is able to install
packages with strategies that do not use <code>dist</code> packages, like <code>.zip</code> and <code>.tar</code>
artifacts.</p>
<p>By default all packages are installed through the <code>auto</code> strategy. This strategy
will attempt to install a dist package, if available, and fall back to the source.
In most cases, this is a clone of your VCS repository, like GIT.</p>
<p>When packages are installed as a dist package, you should not edit the files in
its resulting vendor directory, because a new composer update or install will
override all your edits.</p>
<h2>When to edit files in a vendor directory</h2>
<p>Editing files in vendor packages is useful when patching bugs or writing new
features for modules / plugins / extensions / bundles of an application project
that has separated its components into multiple Composer packages.</p>
<p>Whenever your package is installed using the <code>source</code> strategy, you are good to
go on editing files in your vendor directory. When a package is installed as
such, assuming your source is a GIT repository, it will do a <code>git clone</code> to
install your package. This means you have a full GIT repository locally and you
can commit and push changes you make.</p>
<p>Now, if you do a <code>composer update</code>, Composer will check if there are unpushed
changes. If it detects any, it will ask you to break off the install / update,
stash changes, remove the package and gives some more options.</p>
<p>On top of this, the command <code>composer status -v</code> becomes relevant and useful.
This command is able to show you, for every vendor package, if it holds any
changes that have not been pushed yet.</p>
<p>When I alter <code>composer.json</code> in the <code>zero-config/preacher</code> package for my website,
the following is shown by <code>composer status -v</code>:</p>
<p><img src="composer-status.png" alt="composer status -v" /></p>
<h2>Setting up a preferred installation strategy</h2>
<p>Let's assume we work for the company ACME inc. and they use Symfony a lot, for
which we are an active contributor. We want to install packages from <code>acme/*</code> and
<code>symfony/*</code> as source and all other packages should install as <code>dist</code>, or fall
back to <code>source</code> when the <code>dist</code> is unavailable.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by putting the following in your global Composer configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "config": {
        "preferred-install": {
            "acme/*": "source",
            "symfony/*": "source",
            "*": "auto"
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The order in which these package patterns are supplied matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> Order matters. More specific patterns should be earlier than more
relaxed patterns. When mixing the string notation with the hash configuration in
global and package configurations the string notation is translated to a <code>*</code>
package pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#preferred-install">the official documentation</a>
for more information on configuring the preferred installation strategy.</p>
<p>Look for the <code>config.json</code> file in your composer home, or create it if it's missing.
The following shows you where your global composer home is located.</p>
<pre><code>composer global config home</code></pre>
<h2>Continually developing a vendor package</h2>
<p>When you, and possibly co-workers, are developing a new feature, you don't want to
be constantly confronted with conflicts during composer updates. In order to
develop a new feature for a vendor package, I suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase the version constraint of your package by 1 minor version</li>
<li>Add a <code>dev-</code> constraint for the same package under <code>require-dev</code> with a version
alias for the new version constraint.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "require": {
        "acme/powder-factory": "^1.0"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "require": {
        "acme/powder-factory": "^1.1"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "acme/powder-factory": "dev-feature/ACME-1 as 1.1.0"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When running <code>composer install --no-dev</code>, it will do a normal production
installation using the constraints in <code>require</code>. Currently, the version <code>1.1.0</code>
is still under development, so it would not be able to install your package until
this new version is released.</p>
<p>When running <code>composer install</code> without the <code>--no-dev</code> option, it will install
the package using the branch <code>feature/ACME-1</code>. The <code>dev-</code> prefix simply tells
Composer it has to look for a branch. This constraint is followed by the alias,
<code>as 1.1.0</code>. This tells Composer to interpret the contents of our branch as if it
were released as version <code>1.1.0</code>, which makes it conform to the version
constraint put in the <code>require</code> section. This is a necessary part, if you have
your <code>minimum-stability</code> set to <code>stable</code>.</p>
<p>With the version constraints set up as done above, every <code>composer update</code> will
look for a new commit in the repository of that package. Whenever a new commit is
available, it will install this commit. If there are local changes, Composer will
ask what to do with these changes. This ensures you don't lose changes you made
between <code>composer update</code> calls.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Changing files under <code>vendor</code> can be done, if your workflow takes into account
some small rules. With the default Composer configuration, it is ill advised to
modify vendor packages.</p>
